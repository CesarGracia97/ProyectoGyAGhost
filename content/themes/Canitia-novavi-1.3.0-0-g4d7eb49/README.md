# Novavi's base
Novavi uses the following libraries;
- [PureCSS](https://github.com/pure-css/pure)
- JQuery (3.1.x)
- Font Awesome 5

# Theme requirements
- Novavi **requires** Ghost version **2.1.0** or newer to install and work as intended. 
- Enable the Ghost API in the Ghost settings panel -> Labs -> Ghost API for the full featureset (although it's likely on by default if you run the latest version).
